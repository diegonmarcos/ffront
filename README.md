# front-master

Registry index for the `front-*` repo family — same model as `cloud-master`
(`~/git/cloud/`), narrowed to front. This repo is an INDEX, not a container:
it holds `repos.json` (the registry) and `clone.sh` (pick which repos to
have locally); the actual clones live as siblings in `~/git/`.

```
./clone.sh                list what exists and what does not
./clone.sh <name>...      clone those, then link them
./clone.sh --all          clone every front-* repo
./clone.sh --link         relink whatever is already cloned
./clone.sh --relink       rewrite every link from the registry
```

`repos.json` is a SUBSET of `~/git/git-repos-master/repos.json` (the
superset index of every repo this account owns) — identical
name/url/private/doc fields, kept in sync by hand same as `cloud/repos.json`
already is.
